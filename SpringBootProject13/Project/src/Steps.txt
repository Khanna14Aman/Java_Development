1: Create project using start.spring.io and add dependency "Spring Web"=> It will have embedded tomcat server. And add dependency "Lombok" it is optional but it will help in reducing the line of codes.
2: Also add "tomcat-jasper" dependency so that jsp pages will get reflected in browser otherwise it will download the file.
3: If you are using jsp and wanted to use tags like c:forEach, c:if, and c:choose for iteration, conditional logic, and flow control instead of writing Java scriptlets in JSP pages, the use this line : <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="jakarta.tags.core" %>
4: Also make sure you have added below dependency in your pox.xml file:
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish.web</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>

5: In application.properties file add below line so it will understand automatically from which folder inside webapp jsp file needs to be return. Also it will define the extension of that.
spring.mvc.view.prefix=/views/
spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp
